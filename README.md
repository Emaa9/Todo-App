# Todo-App

This app allows you to add tasks you want to do. You can add tasks, 
update, or delete them. The app run on the server and the server is 
connected with database. For database I used MongoDB, and the tasks that 
you input are stored in the database. The whole app is created with React.js, HTML and CSS .I used Redux Toolkit for managing the state and Redux DevTools for debugging application's state changes.
